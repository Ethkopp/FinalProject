# Project Name
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, November 2023

## Theme
We interpreted the theme "inside out" by making a 2D Platformer that requires you to traverse out of a cave

## Game Play

The objective is to make it to the cave exit and evade all mobs.

Game-play instructions

Press W to jump and A and D control side movement

## Impediments
Had certain struggles implementing features like portals.

## Implementation
The player sprite is from [MV Platformer Male](https://opengameart.org/content/mv-platformer-male-32x64) by MoikMellah. CC0 Licensed.

The [tilemap](https://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer) is from Kenney.nl.
